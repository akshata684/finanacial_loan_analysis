# finanacial_loan_analysis

This project focuses on cleaning, preparing, and analyzing a real-world loan dataset using Python.
The main goal is to demonstrate strong Data Cleaning, Feature Understanding, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Data Cleaning Performed

This project includes multiple real-world data cleaning steps:

✔ Handling missing values

✔ Removing duplicates

✔ Fixing inconsistent data formats

✔ Converting data types

✔ Handling outliers

✔ Fixing incorrect or unrealistic values

✔ Creating new columns for analysis

✔ Standardizing categorical values


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Created multiple visualizations to understand the dataset:

Top 5 State by Total Loan Applicants

Verification Status of Borrower’s Income

Percentage of Loan Status

Total Applicants by Home Ownership

Loan Performance by Grade


📌 Key Insights

Most borrowers (83.32%) have fully repaid their loans, indicating overall good repayment behavior in the dataset.
Only 13.83% loans are charged off, showing a moderate default rate, while 2.85% are still current, representing ongoing repayments.

Most applicants either rent (18,393) or have a mortgage (17,157), indicating that the majority do not fully own their homes.
Very few applicants fully own their homes, so non–homeowners (renters + mortgage holders) have a higher need to apply for loans.

Higher grades (A–C) show strong repayment, with most loans marked as Fully Paid
Defaults increase in lower grades (E–G), indicating higher credit risk.
Grade B has the highest number of loans and still maintains a good repayment rate

Majority of loans are Fully Paid, followed by Charged Off & Current.

The dataset contained several inconsistencies which required heavy cleaning.

No strong visible correlation between annual income and loan amount (data spread is wide).
