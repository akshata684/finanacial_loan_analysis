# finanacial_loan_analysis

This project focuses on cleaning, preparing, and analyzing a real-world loan dataset using Python.
The main goal is to demonstrate strong Data Cleaning, Feature Understanding, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Data Cleaning Performed

This project includes multiple real-world data cleaning steps:

✔ Handling missing values

✔ Removing duplicates

✔ Fixing inconsistent data formats

✔ Converting data types

✔ Handling outliers

✔ Fixing incorrect or unrealistic values

✔ Creating new columns for analysis

✔ Standardizing categorical values


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Created multiple visualizations to understand the dataset:

Top 5 State by Total Loan Applicants

Verification Status of Borrower’s Income

Percentage of Loan Status

Total Applicants by Home Ownership

Loan Performance by Grade


📌 Key Insights

Majority of loans are Fully Paid, followed by Charged Off & Current.

The dataset contained several inconsistencies which required heavy cleaning.

No strong visible correlation between annual income and loan amount (data spread is wide).
